## Launching your Application

You will be able to see and launch all activities owned by you or any teams you are a member of via the Developer Application Shelf. One caveat is that the application will not be shown on the current platform (web/ios/android) unless you have checked your platform in `Settings/Supported Platforms` on the developer portal.  
To enable the `Developer Application Shelf` follow these steps:

### Web

1. Select ⚙️User Settings > App Settings > Advanced and toggle on `Developer Mode`
2. In the same setting menu, also toggle on `Developer Application Shelf`
3. Close the settings window and enter a voice channel.
4. From either the RTC Panel or the Center Control Tray, click on the yellow "Rocket Button" to open the Application shelf. You should now see all of the same applications that you have access to in the developer portal. Note: The shelf will only include applications which have been flagged as "Embeddded"
5. If appropriate, you can enable the Application URL override. If enabled, this will load the application via any arbitrary url and bypass Discord's application proxy. See [Running an application locally](#running-an-application-locally) for more details.
6. Click on an application to launch it!

### Mobile
